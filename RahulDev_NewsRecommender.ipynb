       "1    All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. \"Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, \"Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype.\" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \"significant\" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. \"A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' \" he said. \"It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. \"Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. \"Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\" Mr. Bonneau said. \"It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.\"\n",

       "      <td>Ethereum, considered by many to be the most promising altcoin, has grabbed the attention of The New York Times. The \"newspaper of record\" has run a big feature story on Ethereum, noting its value has spiraled 1,000% in the last three months and is attracting interest from major financial companies that are using it for private blockchains and smart contracts. The story notes the first public version of Ethereum was recently released. The story noted there are numerous applications built on Ethereum that allow new ways to place bets, pay bills and even launch Ponzi schemes. Some cryptocurrency observers claim Ethereum will face more security issues than bitcoin due to its more complex software. The alt. currency system has faced less testing and suffered fewer attacks than bitcoin. The unusual design could also invite more regulatory scrutiny considering some potentially fraudulent contracts can be written into the system. Capabilities Draw Interest However, the system's capabilities have drawn interest from major corporations. Last year, IBM announced it was testing the alt.currency system as a way to manage real-world objects in the Internet of Things. Microsoft has been working on various projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its Azure computing cloud. Marley Gray, a business development and strategy director at Microsoft, said Ethereum is a platform for solving problems in different industries. He called it the most \"elegant\" solution seen to date. Private Blockchains Expand Many companies have created private blockchains using Ethereum. These private blockchains could eventually undermine the value of the Ether, the individual unit in the alt.currency system that people have been buying. Major banks have shown interest in using blockchains to make transferring and trading money more efficient. Several banks have examined how to use Ethereum. JPMorgan has developed a tool called Masala that enables its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum-blockchain. Michael Novogratz, who helped lead Fortress Investing Group invest in bitcoin, has been examining Ethereum since leaving Fortress last fall. He said he has made a significant purchase of Ether. Novogratz said in the last few months that the alt.currency is getting more validation. Ethereum Value Soars Ether's value has increased to as high as $12 from $1 since the beginning of the year, taking the value of all Ether currency to above $1 billion at times. This surpasses the value of any virtual currency besides bitcoin, which claimed more than $6 billion in value last week. Ethereum leads all altcoins in the size of its following One difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is that the latter came into being in a more transparent fashion. Where bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity remains a mystery, Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin , a 21-year-old Russian, who created it after dropping out of Waterloo University in Ontario. Aim Was Smart Contracts Ethereum's basic aim was to make it possible to program agreements into the blockchain. This is the smart contract concept. Two people could, for instance, program a sport bet directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once a mutually-accepted source announced the final score (such as the Associated Press), the winnings would transfer automatically to the winner. Ether can be used as currency. Ether is also necessary to pay for the network power required to process the bet. Ethereum has been characterized as a single-shared computer operated by the network of users on which resources are doled out and paid for by Ether. Buterin's team raised $18 million through an Ether presale in 2014 to help fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the development of the software. Also read: Ether co-founder Vitalik Buterin on public and private blockchains Ethereum's Following Ethereum has attracted followers who have supported the software and hope that Ether will rise in value. There were 5,800 nodes, or computers, last week supporting the network. The bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. Joseph Lubin, a co-founder, established ConsenSys, which has hired more than 50 developers to create applications on the alt.currency system. One enables music distribution while another permits a new type of financial auditing. Lubin said he became interested in Ethereum after determining it delivered on some of bitcoin's failed promise, particularly when it came to permitting new types of online markets and contracts. He said Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver on the broad strokes vision that bitcoin presented. Joseph Bonneau, a Stanford computer science researcher, said Ethereum is the first system that caught his interest since bitcoin. Ethereum is nonetheless far from a certainty, Bonneau said. He said bitcoin is still most likely the safest bet, with Ethereum number two. He said Ethereum's longevity will depend on real markets developing around it.

The competition between Bitcoin and Ethereum is real, but it is not taking place in the same niche market. Unlike what most people think, Ethereum and Bitcoin are not achieving the same goal per se, as the former is focusing on making the blockchain more appealing to everyday users, whereas Bitcoin is all about changing the financial sector.

The world's leading digital currency provides anyone in the world with access to financial services on a global scale, and the end user is always in full control of their finances regardless of which device they are using. In the end, it all comes down to drawing the line between these two respectable digital currencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum can peacefully coexist, and they are competing against something. Yet that something is not each other, as they are not trying to achieve the same goal in their current form. For the digital currency enthusiast, which we all are in our hearts, this is a good thing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just a few months after the platform's production launch, the first Ethereum startups are already receiving interest, and in some cases, undisclosed investments, from digital currency-focused VC firms. Interviews with four of the leading blockchain and digital currency industry investors revealed that many are already performing due diligence on startups utilizing the decentralized application platform. Announced in 2014, Ethereum has gained significant traction of late following a successful hard fork and testing from major financial institutions. Travis Scher, investment associate at Digital Currency Group ( DCG ), for instance, said the New York-based firm has so far evaluated 20 to 30 startups working on Ethereum, while Blockchain Capital managing partner told CoinDesk that the firm has already made two as-yet-undisclosed investments in such startups. Stephens said that Blockchain Capital, one of the technology's most active early-stage investors, is \"bullish\" on Ethereum due to the positive feedback its technology has received from institutions. The firm has even appointed a junior associate, Jeremy Gardner, to focus on the area for its portfolio, which includes industry startups such as Coinbase and Xapo . Stephens told CoinDesk: \"We love bitcoin, we love the bitcoin blockchain, but we also see a multi-chain future. Some of the enterprise customers are interested in federated and private chains and Ethereum is pretty high on the list.\" When announced, such an investment would mark an early sign of confidence for Ethereum, which only recently launched with a limited set of features. In the months and years ahead, the platform plans a number of complex updates, including a switch from proof-of-work transaction verification to a proof-of-stake approach. Other bitcoin and blockchain-focused venture firms including DCG, Boost VC and Pantera Capital indicated they are interested in investing in Ethereum startups, but have not yet provided funding to any entrepreneurs. DCG said it expects to make its first investment in a digital currency company in Q2 or Q3 of 2016, and that \"a few\" Ethereum startups would likely join its portfolio by the year's end. By contrast, the first investment in a company working on the bitcoin protocol wasn't made until April 2012, more than three years after its first block was mined in January 2009. At the time, Draper Associates made a seed investment in the now-defunct bitcoin-focused incubator CoinLab . Investment challenges As for why investors aren't yet placing any bets, most respondents suggested they felt it was too early to tell how strong Ethereum's ecosystem will remain. Such statements coincide with long-standing statements from industry investors that the health of bitcoin's developer ecosystem is one of its most attractive attributes. \"One of the challenges in evaluating Ethereum startups is the community is still fairly small and some of the entrepreneurs are newer to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it difficult to navigate,\" Meltem Demirors, director of community at DCG, told CoinDesk. Demirors went on to describe the early bitcoin ecosystem as perhaps more connected and more technical than the Ethereum ecosystem of today. Others, like Brayton Williams, co-founder of Silicon Valley-based incubator Boost VC, indicated that there is perhaps a lack of mature entrepreneurs building on the technology. \"For us we need to first find great people who are out to solve a problem and that are confident Ethereum could be the solution or provide tools for the solution,\" he told CoinDesk. \"We do our best to avoid those who are just very excited about Ethereum technology and then go try to find a problem.\" Paul Veradittakit, venture investor at Pantera Capital , noted that his firm is often pegged as a bitcoin-only investor, but that it has been eager to take a multi-blockchain approach, something he suggested Ethereum now allows. Yet, he said the firm has questions about how the technology will overcome upcoming challenges. \"You want to make sure that security is well thought out, the scalability, in terms of what are the use cases,\" Veradittakit said. \"We've been monitoring it.\" Veradittakit said Pantera has no plans as of now to offer an ether fund to complement its bitcoin fund, introduced in 2014 . Bitcoin startup interest A driver factor behind the interest, respondents said, is that digital currency industry firms are paying attention to, and implementing, Ethereum as part of their market approach. Stephens noted that a number of Blockchain Capital's portfolio firms, including Bitfinex , Kraken and BitGo , are now offering Ethereum services, and that GoCoin, a payment processing firm, would soon add support. \"We're seeing a lot of companies add Ethereum. Instead of selling chocolate, now they have chocolate and vanilla,\" he said. Demirors said that some DCG portfolio companies are taking a similar path, building infrastructure for the ecosystem's service providers. \"I think many of the early movers we'll see in this ecosystem are existing bitcoin companies that can leverage their operational capabilities and strategic relationships with banks, regulators and other stakeholders to begin building a robust, global network for exchanging, holding, storing and managing ether,\" she said. Notably, such a logic has been historically used by the financial industry to suggest why it might be more able to help blockchain-based technologies reach the mass market. Growth potential As for the growth potential for Ethereum startups, respondents were mixed on projections. DCG's Scher said that a cornerstone of its investment thesis is that bitcoin is both a secure store of value and a financial rail, and that Ethereum is unlikely to compete against the bitcoin in these areas. However, Scher sees Ethereum potentially competing against bitcoin in serving as a platform for smart contracts, identity management and provenance, other potentially large and impactful areas for the technology. \"Startups building these types of products and services may opt to use Ethereum in the future because of its ease of use and other features that it possesses, and that's a terrific development for us and the blockchain ecosystem,\" he said. Demirors said she believes the Ethereum community could one day surpass bitcoin in terms of the number of developers it attracts due to an easier scripting language, but said that it's not out of the question innovators won't find solutions to these issues. Stephens noted that he sees interest in Ethereum as positive, but that VC firms are just now beginning to analyze the industry for potential investments. \"It's still early. We've met with over a dozen companies, and only a few of them in our opinion are investable,\" Stephens said, concluding: \"I think that will change.\" Disclaimer: Homestead image via Ethereum Blockchain Capital Boost VC Digital Currency Group Ethereum Pantera CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Millions of Microsoft developers are now able to build decentralized applications using the Ethereum blockchain thanks to a collaboration between the software giant and Consensys, announced today. By building Ethereum's Solidity programming language for writing smart contracts directly into Mircosoft's Visual Studio platform, developers will be able to build, test and deploy decentralized applications, or dapps , within an integrated environment they already know how to use. But don't think this is a money play for either Consensys, or Microsoft, at least not yet. In a conversation with CoinDesk, CEO of Consensys, Joe Lubin said that growing the number of developers using the distributed ledger technology was first and foremost about reimagining social, economic and political systems. Lubin, who is also the co-founder of Ethereum told CoinDesk: \"It's in our best interest, and in our mission, to help with the adoption of Ethereum in all its different forms - public, private, consortium - and this just makes that that much easier.\" The Consensys integration with Microsoft uses smart contract programming language Solidity to let developers run programs on the Ethereum network, also called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Announced today at Microsoft's Build Conference in San Francisco, the new functionality was scheduled to go live this morning at 10am EST. With Ethereum's Solidity language, developers will be able to write applications using self-enforcing smart contracts that can theoretically execute as wide a range of business transactions as the coder can imagine. Ethereum's cryptocurrency, ether, powers the applications, and is currently valued at about $11.60, with a market cap of over $900m. By comparison, bitcoin's market cap is $6.3 billion. The EVM transactions - or smart contract executions as they may be more accurately called - can then be recorded on what Consensys described in a statement as a \"non-repudiable and authoritative\" record using either the public or private versions of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum's Room to Grow Until recently Ethereum adoption has been slow, even if it is accelerating. For example, the number of Ethereum repositories on GitHub, a reflection of how frequently developers are using the distributed ledger in their projects has grown at an exponential rate since January 2014, from less than 10 to about 460 by the end of 2015, according to analysis conducted by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Using the same methodology, we calculated that number has more than doubled to 997 repositories, in the past three months alone. But when compared to bitcoin, where there are currently 7,647 bitcoin repositories in GitHub, there's plenty room to grow before Ethereum becomes a serious competitor. Marley Gray, director of business development and strategy for blockchain at Microsoft thinks his company's large pool of developers could change that. As of July 2015, when Microsoft launched its most recent version of Visual Studio more than 3.2 million developers were registered on the platform, and the gallery of tools had been downloaded 13 million times in the previous year. \"This integration with Visual Studio will offer developers enterprise-grade solutions with advanced capabilities for teams working on blockchain smart contract projects of any size and complexity,\" Gray said in a statement. While Consensys' CEO said he doesn't plan on making any money directly from the collaboration, he was clear in his conversation with CoinDesk that the effort to make it easier for developers to build dapps was no act of philanthropy. Lubin said: \"We at Consesys are a for-profit entity and we are building products on [the Ethereum] platform. We are building professional services and consulting on that platform, so it makes it so much easier for us to offer that kind of an environment to our customers and using that environment we can offer further services. Business of Ethereum Based in Brooklyn, New York, the self-funded Consensys is currently generating revenue from deals it has closed with institutional clients. Consensys declined to share the names of its clients. Currently, Consensys employs about 70 people around the world, 30 of which are based at their headquarters in New York City, Keys said. He estimates that 80% of the staff work on a full-time basis and are compensated through a combined equity and payment structure. \"Everybody's a stakeholder,\" he told CoinDesk. \"It just depends on when they started.\" Consensys also isn't sharing its specific revenue numbers. But Keys said it has no intention of being profitable anytime soon. \"We just want to keep hiring people. We're at 70 now and if we find the right people we'll hire immediately,\" he said. For an idea of the growth rate the company expects, it plans to more than double the workforce by the end of 2016, employing 150 people on a full-time basis, Keys said. Symbiotic relationship Consensys' deal with Microsoft is a true collaboration, with neither party paying the other to be involved in any way, said Lubin. In fact, both companies have benefited elsewhere by working together. In November 2015, Consensys was the first company to join Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service designed to let other companies experiment in a sandbox environment with the distributed ledger technology. As a result, Microsoft was able cut out its place in the blockchain industry as one of the largest early movers, and Consensys earned the credibility of partnering with a $427bn publicly traded company. The relationship, Lubin thinks, will continue thanks in no small part to today's news. Lubin described Visual Studio to CoinDesk: \"It's one of the best software developer tools on the planet, and this [collaboration] is like adding the vocabulary to build different kinds of programs to your development repertoire.\" ConsenSys Ethereum Microsoft Microsoft Azure</td>\n",

But at the same time, Cashila is the world's first Bitcoin payment processor with a license by a Central Bank, showing there is a way to bridge the gap between both sides of the financial sector. The new service offered by this company lets users buy, sell, and store Ethereum in a quick and convenient way. Also read: Wheel of Doge Allows Players to Use Any Coin Through ShapeShift Cashila Ventures Into The Ethereum World It is not uncommon to see existing platforms explore the Ethereum side of things as well since there is a lot of revenue to be made from doing so. Various Bitcoin exchanges offer consumers a way to easily buy and sell Ether, the token of the Ethereum protocol. Kraken, Bitfinex, Coincheck, and Korbit are just a few of the platforms to have done so in the past year. But when it comes to payment processors, there does not seem to be any indication of them looking to embrace soon. Cashila is the first one to do, and they have big plans for expanding their service in the next few weeks. Right now, the company is best-known for enabling users to make daily payments - or direct wire transfers - to anyone in the European Union by using Bitcoin. Moreover, users can receive Bitcoin or payments denominated in EUR to their online Cashila wallet . But ever since the Ethereum developers released Homestead, there has been growing internal talk about the addition of Ether to the platform. Although it remains unclear whether or not this new service will be a standalone platform or just a part of the current services, the plan is to let Cashila users exchange between EUR and Ether on-the-go. In return, this should bring additional liquidity to both markets. Cashila Co-founder Jani Valjavec stated: \"Buying Ether is currently too hard for an average person. That's why we're building the easiest possible way for one to buy and securely store Ether.\" To make the process of buying and selling Ethereum a lot more convenient for users, the company has been actively developing a new unnamed service. Although the name remains unknown for now, we do know the new service will let users buy and sell with just one click, at a fixed price. Additionally, the new service will support both the ETH and EUR wallet , allowing for quick conversions between both types of currency. Last but not least, it will be possible for EU customers to deposit and withdraw funds through SEPA, assuming one live sin any of the countries supporting this payment method. Low Costs And No Verification Needed One of the biggest drawbacks for novice users is how they have to go through a thorough verification procedure before being able to buy Ethereum on most exchanges. Cashila is taking a different approach, as users will not need to provide any documentation to verify their identity. However, there will be an EUR 1,000 trading limit in place, which can be lifted by submitting the necessary documents. Most convenient exchange solutions charge - sometimes rather high - fees for that particular service, but Cashila wants to keep the costs a slow as possible. Based on the information we have received, there will be a 1% fee applied to trades, and conversions to SEPA can be done any working day. Moreover, storing ETH can be done through the secure online wallet , which will support 2FA for all the key actions. What are your thoughts on this new service announcement by Cashila?

       "      <td>Following Ethereum's production-ready software release earlier this month, digital currency exchanges are now adding support for the native token that powers its blockchain, ether (ETH). In recent weeks, the majority of announcements have come from Asia, where exchanges in China, Japan and South Korea have all added support for ETH trading. Such actions follow the news that Bitfinex, one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges, had added support for the digital currency on 12th March . Regional exchanges that have since announced support for ETH trading including Coincheck, CHBTC, Korbit and Quoine - exchanges that have raised upwards of $5m in combined venture funding. Quoine CEO Mario Gomez Lozada reported that his Singapore-based exchange has already seen an influx of trading activity for ether, telling CoinDesk: \"We did a few thousand ether on launch day, most of it from Japanese traders, and we reached over 1,000 BTC trading volume in ETH/BTC shortly after. Our Japanese traders immediately embraced ether.\" The announcements coincide with escalating interest in ether trading after its market capitalization rose above $1bn earlier this month. At press time, its market cap had subsided, declining to roughly $937m after a period of price volatility. The price of ether at press time was under $12 across exchanges, a figure buoyed by trader interest in the digital currency. High hopes Exchange representatives voiced enthusiasm for Ethereum, as well as their hope that it could extend the market for digital currencies by making headway on use cases where bitcoin startups have yet to find success. \"Bitcoin was all about money. We hope Ethereum will be everything other than money. Therefore, it's natural for us to support ether,\" Coincheck business development lead Kagayaki Kawabata told CoinDesk. Coincheck has since added support for leveraged ether trading, allowing traders to borrow up to five times leverage on ether trades. Kawabata indicated that interest in Ethereum remains low, but he suggested that corporate interest, on the level of a regional Microsoft lending support, could boost awareness. Further, Gomez Lozada said that he believes Ethereum is attracting new traders to his exchange and fostering interest in digital currencies and blockchain tech. \"We have seen new traders joining the platform and exclusively trading ETH,\" he said. Still, not all of the region's exchanges are ready to embrace Ethereum. Xu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, said it is interested in the technology developments but that it has no plans to add support for ether. Qing said: \"We still keep an open mind to outstanding [digital currencies]. Any new digital currency needs time for market validation and acceptance ranging from issuing mechanisms to market liquidity.\" Asia image via Shutterstock</td>\n",

       "      <td>Many of the people I meet believe that bitcoin is bad and will fail. It's rare to meet anyone who says that it could change the world and will succeed. But I've found one and he happens to have written a very good blog about it: Akin Fernandez, Entrepreneur Developer of Azteco . It's a long read, but worth it if you want to be informed. TL;DR If you have software that does something that is valuable, it will sell itself once people hear about it. What other people are doing wrong does not impact your software. There are some interesting and sportsmanlike debates happening around software properties and philosophy in the area of Bitcoin and the Blockchain. There are two distinct camps in this fascinating debate; the software developers and the non software developers . The non software developers can be characterized as Statist Sceptics . On top of not understanding how Bitcoin works, they do not like Bitcoin in principle , because they are Statists , and they are doubtful (without reason) that it can gain traction and spread globally. They have been Moving the Goalposts (a ) for several years in debates about Bitcoin, and have had to concede humiliating defeat many times as Bitcoin resists all their baseless nonsense and hopelessly bad predictions. First they said Bitcoin was a Ponzi Scheme, then they said it was only for \"techies\" then they said it was a bubble, then they said some other nonsense about it . Now, no one says any of those things, and they are onto the next iteration of their FUD; for example, the transaction rate is \"not fast enough\". They have conceded that Bitcoin works exactly as specified, and are running out of novel attacks. The rumblings of complete capitulation are starting to be written, and its a distinct pleasure to read them. Compounding the anti-Bitcoin proponent's frustration are voices that they recognize as deeply authoritative ( IBM ), saying that, \"The underlying technology could change everything\". Those that are retreating into that camp now say, \" And also Bitcoin \" when they talk about \"Blockchain Technology\" as the latest way to try an diminish the world changing effect Bitcoin will have. All the Bitcoin detractors have several characteristics in common. 1 They do not develop software 2 They do not understand or use cryptography 3 They do not have the language to describe cryptography 4 They have a quasi religious belief in the necessity of the State 5 Their only way in to the software world is by analogy Without an understanding of cryptography, it is not possible to understand why Bitcoin works. Without an understanding of Austrian Economics, it is not possible to understand why Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units. Without an understanding of software and its history, it is not possible to predict the future course Bitcoin will take. If you do not understand cryptography, specifically, Pretty Good Privacy , it will be difficult to understand the idea of a cryptographic signature, and its properties. Bitcoin is not a system of \"Smart Contracts\"; it is a system that uses cryptographic signatures to verify that a piece of text is now \"locked\" to the owner of a private key, who has the sole power to unlock that text and sign control over it to another owner of a different private key. All of this takes place on a public ledger. This is not at all like a contract, and neither is it \"smart\". In order to \"send\" Bitcoin to another person ( N.B. sending and receiving Bitcoin never actually happens, you simply sign an entry in the ledger and your balance, the number of entries you can sign, changes which is represented as a number ), you must use your private key to sign a message that is verified by the network. The system that controls this and verifies that the same signature on a piece of text can only be assigned to one key at a time is the breakthrough in The Double Spending problem , the explicit reason that Bitcoin was developed. This system can be used for other purposes that require registration of signed text, that is certain, but the Blockchain was developed specifically to facilitate the creation of a system of money that is free from government control, and immune to inflation. This idea, the idea of sound money, is anathema to Statists. They love government money that robs the poor and is the source of many of the troubles we face today. Do you see what I did there? I described what Bitcoin is, without using any poor analogies and stating only the facts. This is important, and I will come back to it later. Bitcoin does what it is designed to do. It does it very well. It will do it even better in the future, and this is something that non software developers do not understand; software is not fixed . The Bitcoin network we have today is not the same as the Bitcoin network at its start. There will be improvements in every area, including the speed at which the network runs. In the past, downloading the entire Blockchain was needed for every peer. Now you can download a pruned version that is smaller, and there are clients that do not require downloading the entire Blockchain at all . Anyone who presents a Straw Man Argument that Bitcoin cannot work because it takes \"too much\" time to confirm transactions, or the transaction volume is small compared to SWIFT or some other centralized system clearly cannot think , and doesn't know anything about software or its history. In the past before the global software precedents, they could have been excused for doubting the spread of any particular software or hardware, as the infamous Clifford Stoll did when he said the web \" would never take off\" but now, in 2015, we have numerous examples of devices and software that spread globally and that scale . The flash drive, which used to hold 64MB, now holds 64GB in the same form factor. There are one thousand and twenty four megabytes in one Gigabyte. That means in the picture below, the top drive has one thousand times more storage space than the bottom drive. I have no doubt that these same people, had you enthusiastically said to them, \"Your 64MB flash drive will hold a in a few years and cost \" would have scoffed at the idea. The same thing is happening with Bitcoin. Men who know nothing about software are scoffing at the idea that Bitcoin can change and improve. Its an a-historical perspective, to use parliamentary language. On IRC, they simply say, \"DERP!\". Often these people group the Blockchain and Bitcoin with tangentially related projects like Ripple, leaving out the crucial details that allow you to distinguish one from another and make a proper judgement, either by deliberate omission or ignorance. Ripple is very different to Bitcoin. It is a \"pre mined\" currency where all the tokens are created at once, by the developers. Bitcoin on the other hand, is designed quite differently. Its money creation mechanism follows a predictable curve, and is achieved through the process of competition between miners. This was done to keep the expansion of money supply under control until all the Bitcoin is generated, and is a direct result of the correct ideas in Austrian Economics. There is no boss, thankfully It is entirely right to say, \"Bitcoin is controlled by no one\". When this construction is used, it is meant to distinguish between Bitcoin and tools like Ripple, which is centrally controlled . Clearly, the Bitcoin miners control their own hardware and software, and the Bitcoin reference client is under the supervision of the man who is currently responsible for it. At the same time, the network requires consensus for it to operate properly, and it cannot be corrupted or gamed by a single entity. This is exactly what is meant by, \"controlled by no one\". It is not controversial to say this, and it is an accurate description of how the Bitcoin network operates. What the Statists do not like about Bitcoin not being under central control, is that its success is a strong, undeniable signal that control by democratic government is not needed for essential societal functions like money, and that there are better ways to organize every aspect of society that do not require government. The idea that money will no longer be the special preserve of the State and its corrupt central banks is deeply disturbing to these men, and so, they do anything they can (which is precisely nothing) and say anything they can (which is too much) to undermine the idea that Bitcoin does not need to be centrally controlled. Comparing any centralized service, like Ripple, which maintains a definitive central ledger in its offices, to Bitcoin is absurd . These two softwares are in completely different categories, and this bad comparison highlights the naked computer illiteracy of the men who make this febrile comparison. Ripple tokens, the way they were generated, who controls them and the software are all crucial pieces of information that you need to grasp before you can make a judgement about it or compare it to Bitcoin. Once you have a grasp of these, you can clearly see that Ripple is nothing at all like Bitcoin . Bitcoin, if you need to make a comparison to existing software, is more like the BitTorrent Protocol . Once again, if you have used BitTorrent, you will know what I am talking about. If you have not, you will not. There is nothing stopping anyone from making clear, detailed distinctions between different software projects. We can say that Ripple is nothing like Bitcoin, and X software is like Y software. This is useful, and shying away from the details is not; in fact, omitting the details of how software works only causes confusion, and helps spread uncertainty. GPG users and promoters are very used to the computer illiterate characters who will say things like, \"Yes! but I'm sure the government can read PGP messages, there is no way that they can't; they can do anything!\" without any evidence or knowledge of what they are talking about. It is only now that Edward Snowden has confirmed that GPG is beyond the reach of the NSA, that their ignorant anti GPG nonsense is forever dispelled as garbage. Once again, this is the Faulty Appeal to Authority fallacy ; GPG works because it works , not because someone says it works. The same is true of Bitcoin. No matter what software you are talking about, you need to make the case as to why it should be adopted by a user. If there is nothing like it to do the job your software can do, your sales pitch is easy. Bitcoin has this advantage; there is nothing like it in terms of what it does and its scale. Other software projects, have a harder case to make. Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssss! Imagine for yourself, a new software project, that wants to leverage a new technique. In order to sell the project, the facts about it need to be explained, and the software demonstrated. Anyone with experience in testing new software knows how these pitches go. They are very short and terse in the text (just as the Bitcoin White Paper is) and you are invited to run the software yourself. The install process is simple, and then the software either does what it developers claim it does, or it does not. Its all simple and straightforward. If the explanation is too long, and the software essentially unusable, then you have an indication that s omething might be wrong . Couple with that, the fact that it doesn't solve an outstanding hard or easy problem, and the second level alarm bells start ringing. BitTorrent and Bitcoin solve two very hard, distinct problems. BitTorrent solves the problem of how to share files to many people without a central server to distribute them serially. In the past, if you wanted to download a large file, you had to line up behind other people who were downloading the file one person at a time. With BitTorrent, the file is broken up into pieces and distributed out of order for re-assembly at the destinations in parallel. It is much faster than a serial download, and each person with a full or partial copy of the file can share the parts of it they have with other people who do not have those parts. Its all coordinated automagically in the software. BitTorrent is a breakthrough in how files are distributed, and was the result of many years of thought on the problem of how to distribute files without a central server. There had been other attempts at solving this problem , and it took several iterations before BitTorrent was developed by one man: Bram Cohen . Bitcoin has a similar history. For decades developers have been trying to solve the problem of creating an efficient intangible money token. After several attempts, the main problem, how to stop people spending the same token twice (a problem of synchronization) was solved in the form of Bitcoin. In each of these cases, the explanation is simple, the software solves a big problem, and you can download it and use it immediately to solve that specific hard problem. Its clear, unambiguous and instantly beneficial. Now back to our imaginary software project. This project does not solve an outstanding problem. It is designed to be a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, usable by any organization that wants to store data. This project is trying to re-purpose the Blockchain software to do the common and simple task of a database of a kind that runs on commodity hardware and free software. There is an explicit rejection of Bitcoin by its developers and promoters and the use of Bitcoin in this project, and most importantly, they have not figured out how to create a Blockchain without Bitcoin ; they try to hide it in a sea of text and jibes describing what they are doing. What is wrong with this picture? This imaginary software that I describe is not trying to solve a real problem . Any organization can download MySQL, hire some developers, not even top flight ones, and create extremely fast applications that do everything they could imagine they need. If they have an extra requirement of being able to audit who wrote what to the database and when, by adding cryptographic signatures to all entries and changes, they could have a completely audit-able and 100% reliable system where who did what and who owns what entry could be infallibly known. I will divert quickly to describe how it could be done. In a trusted organization that requires verifiable database entries, it is possible to use GPG signatures to stamp each entry in a way that makes them unforgeable and tamper evident . To do this, you issue everyone with write access to the database, a GPG Keypair that they use to sign entries and changes. Each signer will have a GPG Keypair, and a separate machine will automatically sign all entries with its own keypair, for time stamping and authenticating entries. To understand how this works and why it is infallible, you need to understand what GPG does, what a cryptographic signature is , and how it can be used to authenticate text, enable non-repudiation of a promise and the integrity of entries that are passed through this tool. Creating a system as I describe here does not require a breakthrough in software or theory. It is doable now, and can scale, and the tools are well understood and secure. The vaunted infallible, incorruptible public ledger features of this system can be had without using the Blockchain or an experimental derivative of it. If you want a database that is filled with entries that are not corruptible, you do not need a Blockchain to achieve it, you need infallible digital signatures precisely of the kind provided by GPG. One of the tell-tale signs of what we call \" \" are features that have no meaning. Imagine a software project that made the claim that they have, \"made Blockchains controllable\" That doesn't mean anything . All software is controllable by default, by the developers who write it. This is not a new feature or a breakthrough, it is simply the way things already are . It is very suspicious that a set of men attack the idea of Bitcoin, rather than expound the value of their own offering. The world needs more software. This is a fact. If you have something that is good, then by all means promote it. Saying that another piece of software, that by your own admission does not even overlap with your use case is a bad thing, quite rightly raises serious questions and suspicions about the true motivation behind such statements, and detracts from the thing you are claiming you are trying to sell. Its complicated Bitcoin is not, \"just a database\" anyone who says this does not understand what a database is, or the achievement of solving the Double Spending Problem. Databases are everywhere, common, and have been for decades. Bitcoin is causing global excitement precisely because it is not \"just a database\" , it is profound and new breakthrough. Bitcoin users do not have a common objective, but use a common means to achieve their objectives. Saying that Bitcoin users have a common objective is like saying people who use the fiat dollar or web servers have a common objective. Clearly they do not; web servers are used to serve web pages . The objectives of the people publishing pages are expressed in the text and images the users post for the world to see. Bitcoin is nothing more than a tool, just like any other tool, and nothing can be implied or imputed onto its users simply because they use it. The Bitcoin designer had a specific aim in mind, and part of his genius was to predict the human reaction to a money that is sound. As the true nature of money is further exposed by Bitcoin's spread, more people will come to distrust and reject fiat money issued by central banks, and the creator of Bitcoin's mission will be complete. Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized. The miners and software maintainers do not have \"limited supervision\" over the network; it is ordered by its operation and doesn't require supervision or control. To say that it does, demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. The only way you can claim that Bitcoin is supervised is to change the meaning of the word \"supervised\" and this is another thing that Bitcoin detractors do; they change the meaning of words to confuse and distract anyone who is trying to understand Bitcoin's operation as a newcomer or computer illiterate that can be swayed by bad arguments because they cannot distinguish the truth and lies about Bitcoin. Blockchains are run on software. They could also be run with pencils and paper and the mail. Blockchains are data . It is wrong to say however, that if you write the rules that you want expressed that they will \"do exactly what we tell them to do\". This is false. The Blockchain works precisely because the rules that govern its operation are finely tuned. The rules that govern its operation is the breakthrough. You cannot simply wave your hands, shout, \"die Bitcoin die\" at the top of your lungs and command that a Blockchain start exhibiting a set of features you desire. That is nonsense on stilts. Problems do not fall to the mind of man on demand. This is why they are problems . The Blockchain and by extension Bitcoin, if it were \"just a database\" or a simple matter of telling computers to \"do exactly what we tell them to do\" would have been invented at the same time that the database was invented . Blockchains are not just databases , they are something very new , and novel , and clearly, very hard to understand for some. You cannot, bearing this in mind, \"obtain the benefits of the Blockchain\" without Bitcoin. This idea, that you can have a Blockchain whilst entirely stripping away Bitcoin by simply writing some software should send up a giant red flag. It is entirely legitimate to desire and imagine and then write any manner of software you want. It may even be possible to create software that seems to be irrational on the surface, but which works. But there are some things that cannot be done , and even if they can, do not need to be done . As I described above, there is no need to use a Blockchain to secure database entries, make them infallible and trustable, and to extend that trust outside of the organization that holds the central database. No new techniques need to be developed to do this, so the question that immediately comes to mind is... Why are they doing this? Recording a cash deposit is easily done on a true database like MySQL, enforcement in a breach of contract is done by courts all the time. You cannot have software enforcement of a payment of money without the valuable token that can be confiscated by the software contract , so removing Bitcoin from your novel offering doesn't make any sense. You need the valuable token to ensure that both parties do what they promise to do. But if your philosophy is that the State should be the sole arbiter in disputes, there is no need for Blockchain contracts ; paper ones will do. It is only in the scenario that you want to replace Government courts as arbitrators in disputes, and lawyers to draft and interpret the law that Blockchain contracts have real, revolutionary utility. Adding an extra layer of complexity to the existing monopoly courts and banking system that even the promoters of the bad idea cannot explain coherently and convincingly is not a good business idea. You cannot simply \"choose to look at Blockchains as an open source database\". First of all the term \"Open Source\" refers to software licenses , not to the license that covers the content stored in them, and the Blockchain is not a simple database; it is far more than that , as I have explained. The entire idea of Blockchains and Bitcoin is that the transactions are irreversible . It is not a beneficial feature to create a Blockchain that has reversible entries on it. If you want that, you use PostgreSQL or MySQL not a hacked version of the software that runs the Bitcoin Blockchain. It is not practical from a business perspective to use tools for something other than what they were designed for, especially when there are mature tools that do exactly what you need without any risk. Take that into account and then superimpose the Procrustean idea of reversible Blockchain transactions, and essentially you are demonstrating that you have entirely missed the point and innovation of the Blockchain. The Blockchain was designed specifically to bring into being a new form of money. It literally is a money printing press. The form of money it generates is clean, ethical, anti-centralization and anti-State. This is why it rankles so many people who are invested in the idea of the State, and who are its certified gatekeepers. There is no right way to do any sort of software. Software is written to meet the needs of its users. If you want to use a database to store pictures of your navel, that is a correct use by default. There is no wrong way to use software, but there is a wrong way to use it if your goal is very specific. If you want an efficient database to be used internally in a corporation or enterprise, you do not need to re-engineer the Blockchain to remove Bitcoin from it to do so. You simply use MySQL or PostgreSQL. You use the right tool for the right job, and you do not force a tool on to a problem simply because the words that describe it are hip and fashionable. The Blockchain was specifically designed to allow Bitcoin and its properties to exist. By definition, that is the correct use case for that software; to create a decentralized, peer to peer digital money substitute without the Double Spending Problem. If you have another novel use case and you re-purpose the software used to create the Blockchain, that is good; but if you do not have a novel use case, you do not need to use the Blockchain. The Blockchain does not need anyone to be right about it, and it does not need to be defended, any more than arithmetic needs to be defended; it just is , and that is all there is to it. Its use and growth is its own defence. Its logic is its own defence. Its utility is its own defence. Most rational people do not have an objection to any software being re-purposed or re-designed. It simply doesn't matter what people choose to do with their time and what software they want to release. Software cannot attack other software. It is irrational violent men who attack other men for holding the \"wrong\" ideas , and of course, the anti Bitcoin men are very eager to physically attack Bitcoin users simply because they use Bitcoin . This is the stark difference in ethics of the evil men who are against Bitcoin and the men who are natural and normal. Software doesn't care about what view you take. It only executes as it is instructed to execute. Either your product works and achieves your aims or it does not. If it does, then you have to convince someone that your offering is worth risking their data and business on. This is the simple truth. A Blockchain is demonstrably not like any other database software. The superficial advantages that the Blockchain offers in terms of proving that something has happened at a certain time or that someone has the keys to unlock an entry, can be trivially replicated on MySQL or PostgreSQL with a GPG layer. Propagating messages in a verifiable way is easily done with SSL and GPG without a central server, using BitTorrent as the transport layer. Anyone familiar with GPG and the Web of Trust knows this. Permissions in MySQL are mature and reliable. If cost savings (and risk savings) are your aim, you would be far better off using the standard tools in an organization, which by its nature is centralized and where accountability and privacy are needed. The Blockchain is for a different purpose; its aim is to move accountability to the network and out of the hands of a central authority . If you are selling something to an organization that requires central authority, you do not need the Blockchain and its guarantees, because these are achievable by compulsion, and verification done by digital signatures. Transparent audit logs are achievable by other means than a Blockchain, and organizations more often than not, like to keep the details of their internal databases private , as they contain business sensitive data. Spreading out the database task into the public onto servers not under the control of the corporation is not something that is desirable. A product that does this is a solution to a problem no one is trying to solve looking for a client that does not exist; the complete opposite of Bitcoin and the Blockchain, which is a solution to a real problem that has been sought after for decades, that everyone needs. You do not need a consensus mechanism in a company where everyone is under centralized control. The board is the consensus mechanism. Computers today are so powerful, and storage so inexpensive, large databases can run on laptops without any problem. Distributing the load over many machines is something that is required only in \"Big Data\" Scientific applications, where the idea of the Blockchain and its record keeping abilities are simply not needed. There is a demonstration floating about from one of the \"Blockchains not Bitcoin\" companies, where they claim to have replicated Netflix on their software. Not only is this use case an example of piracy of copyrighted material, but this function is already efficiently done with BitTorrent on a global scale. These new Blockchain derivative products do not know what they want to be, and of course, Netflix does not want a distributed system in the way they devise, they want a centralized system so they can profit. The only thing they could want in terms of distributed architecture is the use of BitTorrent to stream films to their customers. Everything that is Blockchain is worthless to them...unless they start taking Bitcoin for on demand viewing of films, which of course, makes the case for Bitcoin as a transformative \"tech\". Someone said that Google could reduce their server costs with a hacked Blockchain. This is absurd. Hardware is very cheap. Re architecting Google's infrastructure to use a Blockchain offers them no advantage whatsoever. Google's needs are simple; they would pay billions for a very fast high level loss-less compression breakthrough. This would mean that their existing infrastructure could instantly have greater capacity with no hardware retrofitting. Apple just had something similar happen to them; a software developer wrote a novel image compression algorithm - they bought it and are incorporating into their software. That is real innovation ; solving specific problems that are well defined, with a novel approach. Uber, AirBnB, Spotify and the vast majority of companies all need simple databases to run their services. The true innovation that helps them is Bitcoin. It reduces the cost of processing payments, and eliminates the risk of fraudulent payments completely. This is not something to be sneered at; it is a revolution in how people pay for services , and it will completely destroy the Credit Card industry forever . What sort of man could possibly be against this? Or claim that it is anything less than one of the most profound beneficial breakthroughs in the history of computers and software? No Straw Man, Faulty Appeal to Authority, corporate gibberish or FUD can stop Bitcoin. Its use case is too obvious and compelling, the savings too great, the elimination of payer fraud too seductive. Bitcoin is real. It is not vaporware . It is here now, you can use it, benefit from it and you don't have to ask anyone's permission to do so. The permissionless nature of Bitcoin is an offence to the Statists, who openly say that every new technology or software should be exposed to scrutiny and regulation by the State, no matter what it is . Bitcoin, being immune from that sort of anti-Americanism , doesn't care what you think , or recommend; it simply is , it will do what it is meant to do, like BitTorrent does, and nothing can stop it. You are not required to like it, integrate with it, use it or even talk about it, and lying about it will not dissuade people from using it. The benefits are obvious to anyone who can think, and those who think instinctively like to save time and money and resent lining up and showing ID to use their own money. Setting up a Blockchain wallet takes literally five minutes and once its done, and you fund it , you have hand-held global access to the entire world market, as a bank, where you can send and receive an unlimited, unrestricted amount of money to anyone, anywhere, instantly. That's a good thing . This is the core of the reason why Statists dislike Bitcoin. It sets people free to do as they like with their own money. Unfortunately for them, its too late to stop Bitcoin. All the vaporware, wishful thinking and FUD in the world can't stop it. Years of bad press written by ignorant men have not stopped its growth, and every day that it grows it is going to become harder to retard. By all means, continue to write your own software, but do not believe for an instant that anything you say can stop Bitcoin. Only software can stop Bitcoin, and to do that, its function needs to be a better Bitcoin than Bitcoin , not any coin that is in any way crippled. Bitcoin has unleashed an idea into the world that will never ever go away . The world has changed. You can either deal with it, or leave it . 14rtDb46NQJkuqFJuHqZG3o6uAWwGbV58z</td>\n",

The \"newspaper of record\" has run a big feature story on Ethereum, noting its value has spiraled 1,000% in the last three months and is attracting interest from major financial companies that are using it for private blockchains and smart contracts. The story notes the first public version of Ethereum was recently released. The story noted there are numerous applications built on Ethereum that allow new ways to place bets, pay bills and even launch Ponzi schemes. Some cryptocurrency observers claim Ethereum will face more security issues than bitcoin due to its more complex software. The alt. currency system has faced less testing and suffered fewer attacks than bitcoin. The unusual design could also invite more regulatory scrutiny considering some potentially fraudulent contracts can be written into the system. Capabilities Draw Interest However, the system's capabilities have drawn interest from major corporations. Last year, IBM announced it was testing the alt.currency system as a way to manage real-world objects in the Internet of Things. Microsoft has been working on various projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its Azure computing cloud. Marley Gray, a business development and strategy director at Microsoft, said Ethereum is a platform for solving problems in different industries. He called it the most \"elegant\" solution seen to date. Private Blockchains Expand Many companies have created private blockchains using Ethereum. These private blockchains could eventually undermine the value of the Ether, the individual unit in the alt.currency system that people have been buying. Major banks have shown interest in using blockchains to make transferring and trading money more efficient. Several banks have examined how to use Ethereum. JPMorgan has developed a tool called Masala that enables its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum-blockchain. Michael Novogratz, who helped lead Fortress Investing Group invest in bitcoin, has been examining Ethereum since leaving Fortress last fall. He said he has made a significant purchase of Ether. Novogratz said in the last few months that the alt.currency is getting more validation. Ethereum Value Soars Ether's value has increased to as high as $12 from $1 since the beginning of the year, taking the value of all Ether currency to above $1 billion at times. This surpasses the value of any virtual currency besides bitcoin, which claimed more than $6 billion in value last week. Ethereum leads all altcoins in the size of its following One difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is that the latter came into being in a more transparent fashion. Where bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity remains a mystery, Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin , a 21-year-old Russian, who created it after dropping out of Waterloo University in Ontario. Aim Was Smart Contracts Ethereum's basic aim was to make it possible to program agreements into the blockchain. This is the smart contract concept. Two people could, for instance, program a sport bet directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once a mutually-accepted source announced the final score (such as the Associated Press), the winnings would transfer automatically to the winner. Ether can be used as currency. Ether is also necessary to pay for the network power required to process the bet. Ethereum has been characterized as a single-shared computer operated by the network of users on which resources are doled out and paid for by Ether. Buterin's team raised $18 million through an Ether presale in 2014 to help fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the development of the software.

There were 5,800 nodes, or computers, last week supporting the network. The bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. Joseph Lubin, a co-founder, established ConsenSys, which has hired more than 50 developers to create applications on the alt.currency system. One enables music distribution while another permits a new type of financial auditing. Lubin said he became interested in Ethereum after determining it delivered on some of bitcoin's failed promise, particularly when it came to permitting new types of online markets and contracts. He said Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver on the broad strokes vision that bitcoin presented. Joseph Bonneau, a Stanford computer science researcher, said Ethereum is the first system that caught his interest since bitcoin. Ethereum is nonetheless far from a certainty, Bonneau said. He said bitcoin is still most likely the safest bet, with Ethereum number two. He said Ethereum's longevity will depend on real markets developing around it. Featured image from Shutterstock.   \n",

is not Ethereum and vice versa. Nor should they be, to be frank, as we have seen enough clones of Bitcoin over the past seven years. Ethereum is doing something entirely different, which is a welcome change in the overflowing oceans of useless altcoins. The competition between Bitcoin and Ethereum is real, but it is not taking place in the same niche market. Unlike what most people think, Ethereum and Bitcoin are not achieving the same goal per se, as the former is focusing on making the blockchain more appealing to everyday users, whereas Bitcoin is all about changing the financial sector. Both are leaders in their niche, but they are not direct competitors either.

Nor should they be, to be frank, as we have seen enough clones of Bitcoin over the past seven years. is doing something entirely different, which is a welcome change in the overflowing oceans of useless altcoins.

The world's leading digital currency provides anyone in the world with access to financial services on a global scale, and the end user is always in full control of their finances regardless of which device they are using. In the end, it all comes down to drawing the line between these two respectable digital currencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum can peacefully coexist, and they are competing against something. Yet that something is not each other, as they are not trying to achieve the same goal in their current form. For the digital currency enthusiast, which we all are in our hearts, this is a good thing.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Just a few months after the platform's production launch, the first Ethereum startups are already receiving interest, and in some cases, undisclosed investments, from digital currency-focused VC firms. Interviews with four of the leading blockchain and digital currency industry investors revealed that many are already performing due diligence on startups utilizing the decentralized application platform. Announced in 2014, Ethereum has gained significant traction of late following a successful hard fork and testing from major financial institutions. Travis Scher, investment associate at Digital Currency Group ( DCG ), for instance, said the New York-based firm has so far evaluated 20 to 30 startups working on Ethereum, while Blockchain Capital managing partner told CoinDesk that the firm has already made two as-yet-undisclosed investments in such startups. Stephens said that Blockchain Capital, one of the technology's most active early-stage investors, is \"bullish\" on Ethereum due to the positive feedback its technology has received from institutions. The firm has even appointed a junior associate, Jeremy Gardner, to focus on the area for its portfolio, which includes industry startups such as Coinbase and Xapo . Stephens told CoinDesk: \"We love bitcoin, we love the bitcoin blockchain, but we also see a multi-chain future. Some of the enterprise customers are interested in federated and private chains and Ethereum is pretty high on the list.\" When announced, such an investment would mark an early sign of confidence for Ethereum, which only recently launched with a limited set of features. In the months and years ahead, the platform plans a number of complex updates, including a switch from proof-of-work transaction verification to a proof-of-stake approach. Other bitcoin and blockchain-focused venture firms including DCG, Boost VC and Pantera Capital indicated they are interested in investing in Ethereum startups, but have not yet provided funding to any entrepreneurs. DCG said it expects to make its first investment in a digital currency company in Q2 or Q3 of 2016, and that \"a few\" Ethereum startups would likely join its portfolio by the year's end. By contrast, the first investment in a company working on the bitcoin protocol wasn't made until April 2012, more than three years after its first block was mined in January 2009. At the time, Draper Associates made a seed investment in the now-defunct bitcoin-focused incubator CoinLab . Investment challenges As for why investors aren't yet placing any bets, most respondents suggested they felt it was too early to tell how strong Ethereum's ecosystem will remain. Such statements coincide with long-standing statements from industry investors that the health of bitcoin's developer ecosystem is one of its most attractive attributes. \"One of the challenges in evaluating Ethereum startups is the community is still fairly small and some of the entrepreneurs are newer to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it difficult to navigate,\" Meltem Demirors, director of community at DCG, told CoinDesk. Demirors went on to describe the early bitcoin ecosystem as perhaps more connected and more technical than the Ethereum ecosystem of today. Others, like Brayton Williams, co-founder of Silicon Valley-based incubator Boost VC, indicated that there is perhaps a lack of mature entrepreneurs building on the technology. \"For us we need to first find great people who are out to solve a problem and that are confident Ethereum could be the solution or provide tools for the solution,\" he told CoinDesk. \"We do our best to avoid those who are just very excited about Ethereum technology and then go try to find a problem.\" Paul Veradittakit, venture investor at Pantera Capital , noted that his firm is often pegged as a bitcoin-only investor, but that it has been eager to take a multi-blockchain approach, something he suggested Ethereum now allows. Yet, he said the firm has questions about how the technology will overcome upcoming challenges. \"You want to make sure that security is well thought out, the scalability, in terms of what are the use cases,\" Veradittakit said. \"We've been monitoring it.\" Veradittakit said Pantera has no plans as of now to offer an ether fund to complement its bitcoin fund, introduced in 2014 . Bitcoin startup interest A driver factor behind the interest, respondents said, is that digital currency industry firms are paying attention to, and implementing, Ethereum as part of their market approach. Stephens noted that a number of Blockchain Capital's portfolio firms, including Bitfinex , Kraken and BitGo , are now offering Ethereum services, and that GoCoin, a payment processing firm, would soon add support. \"We're seeing a lot of companies add Ethereum. Instead of selling chocolate, now they have chocolate and vanilla,\" he said. Demirors said that some DCG portfolio companies are taking a similar path, building infrastructure for the ecosystem's service providers. \"I think many of the early movers we'll see in this ecosystem are existing bitcoin companies that can leverage their operational capabilities and strategic relationships with banks, regulators and other stakeholders to begin building a robust, global network for exchanging, holding, storing and managing ether,\" she said. Notably, such a logic has been historically used by the financial industry to suggest why it might be more able to help blockchain-based technologies reach the mass market. Growth potential As for the growth potential for Ethereum startups, respondents were mixed on projections. DCG's Scher said that a cornerstone of its investment thesis is that bitcoin is both a secure store of value and a financial rail, and that Ethereum is unlikely to compete against the bitcoin in these areas. However, Scher sees Ethereum potentially competing against bitcoin in serving as a platform for smart contracts, identity management and provenance, other potentially large and impactful areas for the technology. \"Startups building these types of products and services may opt to use Ethereum in the future because of its ease of use and other features that it possesses, and that's a terrific development for us and the blockchain ecosystem,\" he said. Demirors said she believes the Ethereum community could one day surpass bitcoin in terms of the number of developers it attracts due to an easier scripting language, but said that it's not out of the question innovators won't find solutions to these issues. Stephens noted that he sees interest in Ethereum as positive, but that VC firms are just now beginning to analyze the industry for potential investments. \"It's still early. We've met with over a dozen companies, and only a few of them in our opinion are investable,\" Stephens said, concluding: \"I think that will change.\" Disclaimer: Homestead image via Ethereum Blockchain Capital Boost VC Digital Currency Group Ethereum Pantera CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.   \n",

                                                                                                                                   Millions of Microsoft developers are now able to build decentralized applications using the Ethereum blockchain thanks to a collaboration between the software giant and Consensys, announced today. By building Ethereum's Solidity programming language for writing smart contracts directly into Mircosoft's Visual Studio platform, developers will be able to build, test and deploy decentralized applications, or dapps , within an integrated environment they already know how to use. But don't think this is a money play for either Consensys, or Microsoft, at least not yet. In a conversation with CoinDesk, CEO of Consensys, Joe Lubin said that growing the number of developers using the distributed ledger technology was first and foremost about reimagining social, economic and political systems. Lubin, who is also the co-founder of Ethereum told CoinDesk: \"It's in our best interest, and in our mission, to help with the adoption of Ethereum in all its different forms - public, private, consortium - and this just makes that that much easier.\" The Consensys integration with Microsoft uses smart contract programming language Solidity to let developers run programs on the Ethereum network, also called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Announced today at Microsoft's Build Conference in San Francisco, the new functionality was scheduled to go live this morning at 10am EST. With Ethereum's Solidity language, developers will be able to write applications using self-enforcing smart contracts that can theoretically execute as wide a range of business transactions as the coder can imagine. Ethereum's cryptocurrency, ether, powers the applications, and is currently valued at about $11.60, with a market cap of over $900m. By comparison, bitcoin's market cap is $6.3 billion. The EVM transactions - or smart contract executions as they may be more accurately called - can then be recorded on what Consensys described in a statement as a \"non-repudiable and authoritative\" record using either the public or private versions of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum's Room to Grow Until recently Ethereum adoption has been slow, even if it is accelerating. For example, the number of Ethereum repositories on GitHub, a reflection of how frequently developers are using the distributed ledger in their projects has grown at an exponential rate since January 2014, from less than 10 to about 460 by the end of 2015, according to analysis conducted by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Using the same methodology, we calculated that number has more than doubled to 997 repositories, in the past three months alone. But when compared to bitcoin, where there are currently 7,647 bitcoin repositories in GitHub, there's plenty room to grow before Ethereum becomes a serious competitor. Marley Gray, director of business development and strategy for blockchain at Microsoft thinks his company's large pool of developers could change that. As of July 2015, when Microsoft launched its most recent version of Visual Studio more than 3.2 million developers were registered on the platform, and the gallery of tools had been downloaded 13 million times in the previous year. \"This integration with Visual Studio will offer developers enterprise-grade solutions with advanced capabilities for teams working on blockchain smart contract projects of any size and complexity,\" Gray said in a statement. While Consensys' CEO said he doesn't plan on making any money directly from the collaboration, he was clear in his conversation with CoinDesk that the effort to make it easier for developers to build dapps was no act of philanthropy. Lubin said: \"We at Consesys are a for-profit entity and we are building products on [the Ethereum] platform. We are building professional services and consulting on that platform, so it makes it so much easier for us to offer that kind of an environment to our customers and using that environment we can offer further services. Business of Ethereum Based in Brooklyn, New York, the self-funded Consensys is currently generating revenue from deals it has closed with institutional clients. Consensys declined to share the names of its clients. Currently, Consensys employs about 70 people around the world, 30 of which are based at their headquarters in New York City, Keys said. He estimates that 80% of the staff work on a full-time basis and are compensated through a combined equity and payment structure. \"Everybody's a stakeholder,\" he told CoinDesk. \"It just depends on when they started.\" Consensys also isn't sharing its specific revenue numbers. But Keys said it has no intention of being profitable anytime soon. \"We just want to keep hiring people. We're at 70 now and if we find the right people we'll hire immediately,\" he said. For an idea of the growth rate the company expects, it plans to more than double the workforce by the end of 2016, employing 150 people on a full-time basis, Keys said. Symbiotic relationship Consensys' deal with Microsoft is a true collaboration, with neither party paying the other to be involved in any way, said Lubin. In fact, both companies have benefited elsewhere by working together. In November 2015, Consensys was the first company to join Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service designed to let other companies experiment in a sandbox environment with the distributed ledger technology. As a result, Microsoft was able cut out its place in the blockchain industry as one of the largest early movers, and Consensys earned the credibility of partnering with a $427bn publicly traded company. The relationship, Lubin thinks, will continue thanks in no small part to today's news. Lubin described Visual Studio to CoinDesk: \"It's one of the best software developer tools on the planet, and this [collaboration] is like adding the vocabulary to build different kinds of programs to your development repertoire.\" ConsenSys Ethereum Microsoft Microsoft Azure   \n",

                                                           Consensys and Microsoft have announced that the Ethereum contract programming language Solidity will be available in Microsoft's Visual Studio integrated development environment. ConsenSys and Microsoft collaborated on this integration to enable developers to rapidly build smart contract-based applications for the public Ethereum blockchain, as well as private and consortium blockchain deployments based on Ethereum. This integration is being revealed at //Build , Microsoft's annual developer conference, in San Francisco on March 30th; Vitalik Buterin, Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin and Consensys Enterprise director Andrew Keys will be present. Vitalik, Andrew and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the //Build pre-conference reception The integration comes in the form of an extension to Visual Studio that creates project scaffolding with smart contract sample code, generates ABI and binary files for deployment, supports context-sensitive menus for compilation and deployment of smart contracts, and build an automatically generated UI for contract calling for testing purposes. This is not the first time that Microsoft has expressed interest in Ethereum technologies; the Ethereum Blockchain as a Service offering has been available since November 2015 , and has expanded to include the BlockApps Strato Ethereum toolkit, as well as several Ethereum applications, including the Cetas decentralized KYC system , the Augur prediction market , and the slock.it IoT platform. We look forward to continuing to work together with Microsoft on bringing Ethereum and blockchain technology to the masses.   \n",

infrastructure. Just recently, ConsenSys and Microsoft have collaborated on integrating 's programming language, Solidity into the company's Visual Studio . The tech giant company has also revealed that Excel 2016 will support Bitcoin's currency format within the MS Office suite. Microsoft Enables Thousands of Devs to Build with Ethereum The reveal of this integration was introduced at Microsoft's Build presentation with Ethereum co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin attending the event. Build focuses on presenting the latest technology and tools to help developers generate innovative concepts. The implementation of the code will allow developers to create with its protocol, building decentralized applications (Dapps), smart contracts, and IoT compatibility. Through this collaboration, Windows users will be able to develop programs via the Ethereum Virtual Network (EVM). Buterin stated: What do you think about Microsoft's deep involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain tech? Could it give them the edge the company once had? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Microsoft, Ethereum Making it easier for developers to build applications on top of Ethereum through developer tools has always been one of our primary interests and focuses, and the integration of Solidity in Visual Studio will help bring Ethereum to a very large developer community. I am looking forward to seeing the results that this collaboration will bring. Solidity is a javascript-like programming language used for developing on the EVM. With the language users can write applications \"that implement self-enforcing business logic embodied in smart contracts , leaving a non-repudiable and authoritative record of transactions.\" Visual Studio is a development environment that is used to build these programs for Windows, Android, and iOS platforms. Director of BizDev & Strategy for Blockchain at Microsoft Marley Gray said of the announcement: This integration with Visual Studio will offer developers enterprise-grade solutions with advanced capabilities for teams working on blockchain Smart Contract projects of any size and complexity. We are excited to continue to support the development and innovation of the distributed ledger ecosystem. Excel 2016 will Support Bitcoin Currency Format The Bitcoin currency format was revealed in the Office 365 Roadmap , which explains the development and upcoming updates to the software suite. Microsoft Office is currently the business application used by companies. Format support is currently in \"development\" but will offer a variety of use cases when it becomes available. The Roadmap states, \"Now use Excel to track, calculate and analyze Bitcoin data using native number formatting options. The feature is first being rolled out to Excel 2016 for Windows, Excel Online, Excel Mobile for Windows and Excel Mobile for Android.\" Microsoft clearly is interested in the digital currency and with Ethereum and Bitcoin being melded into its software. Projects like the cloud-based Microsoft Azure program and the blockchain environment acceptance of this emerging technology has been profound. The company still accepts Bitcoin and is now integrating certain elements of these technologies to prepare for the future. Jamie Redman is a Bitcoin enthusiast, trader, journalist and graphic artist.

banks and companies active in the world of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. But at the same time, Cashila is the world's first Bitcoin payment processor with a license by a Central Bank, showing there is a way to bridge the gap between both sides of the financial sector. The new service offered by this company lets users buy, sell, and store Ethereum in a quick and convenient way. Also read: Wheel of Doge Allows Players to Use Any Coin Through ShapeShift Cashila Ventures Into The Ethereum World It is not uncommon to see existing platforms explore the Ethereum side of things as well since there is a lot of revenue to be made from doing so. Various Bitcoin exchanges offer consumers a way to easily buy and sell Ether, the token of the Ethereum protocol. Kraken, Bitfinex, Coincheck, and Korbit are just a few of the platforms to have done so in the past year. But when it comes to payment processors, there does not seem to be any indication of them looking to embrace soon. Cashila is the first one to do, and they have big plans for expanding their service in the next few weeks. Right now, the company is best-known for enabling users to make daily payments - or direct wire transfers - to anyone in the European Union by using Bitcoin. Moreover, users can receive Bitcoin or payments denominated in EUR to their online Cashila wallet . But ever since the Ethereum developers released Homestead, there has been growing internal talk about the addition of Ether to the platform. Although it remains unclear whether or not this new service will be a standalone platform or just a part of the current services, the plan is to let Cashila users exchange between EUR and Ether on-the-go. In return, this should bring additional liquidity to both markets. Cashila Co-founder Jani Valjavec stated: \"Buying Ether is currently too hard for an average person. That's why we're building the easiest possible way for one to buy and securely store Ether.\" To make the process of buying and selling Ethereum a lot more convenient for users, the company has been actively developing a new unnamed service. Although the name remains unknown for now, we do know the new service will let users buy and sell with just one click, at a fixed price. Additionally, the new service will support both the ETH and EUR wallet , allowing for quick conversions between both types of currency. Last but not least, it will be possible for EU customers to deposit and withdraw funds through SEPA, assuming one live sin any of the countries supporting this payment method. Low Costs And No Verification Needed One of the biggest drawbacks for novice users is how they have to go through a thorough verification procedure before being able to buy Ethereum on most exchanges. Cashila is taking a different approach, as users will not need to provide any documentation to verify their identity. However, there will be an EUR 1,000 trading limit in place, which can be lifted by submitting the necessary documents. Most convenient exchange solutions charge - sometimes rather high - fees for that particular service, but Cashila wants to keep the costs a slow as possible. Based on the information we have received, there will be a 1% fee applied to trades, and conversions to SEPA can be done any working day. Moreover, storing ETH can be done through the secure online wallet , which will support 2FA for all the key actions. What are your thoughts on this new service announcement by Cashila?

                                  Following Ethereum's production-ready software release earlier this month, digital currency exchanges are now adding support for the native token that powers its blockchain, ether (ETH). In recent weeks, the majority of announcements have come from Asia, where exchanges in China, Japan and South Korea have all added support for ETH trading. Such actions follow the news that Bitfinex, one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges, had added support for the digital currency on 12th March . Regional exchanges that have since announced support for ETH trading including Coincheck, CHBTC, Korbit and Quoine - exchanges that have raised upwards of $5m in combined venture funding. Quoine CEO Mario Gomez Lozada reported that his Singapore-based exchange has already seen an influx of trading activity for ether, telling CoinDesk: \"We did a few thousand ether on launch day, most of it from Japanese traders, and we reached over 1,000 BTC trading volume in ETH/BTC shortly after. Our Japanese traders immediately embraced ether.\" The announcements coincide with escalating interest in ether trading after its market capitalization rose above $1bn earlier this month. At press time, its market cap had subsided, declining to roughly $937m after a period of price volatility. The price of ether at press time was under $12 across exchanges, a figure buoyed by trader interest in the digital currency. High hopes Exchange representatives voiced enthusiasm for Ethereum, as well as their hope that it could extend the market for digital currencies by making headway on use cases where bitcoin startups have yet to find success. \"Bitcoin was all about money. We hope Ethereum will be everything other than money. Therefore, it's natural for us to support ether,\" Coincheck business development lead Kagayaki Kawabata told CoinDesk. Coincheck has since added support for leveraged ether trading, allowing traders to borrow up to five times leverage on ether trades. Kawabata indicated that interest in Ethereum remains low, but he suggested that corporate interest, on the level of a regional Microsoft lending support, could boost awareness. Further, Gomez Lozada said that he believes Ethereum is attracting new traders to his exchange and fostering interest in digital currencies and blockchain tech. \"We have seen new traders joining the platform and exclusively trading ETH,\" he said. Still, not all of the region's exchanges are ready to embrace Ethereum. Xu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, said it is interested in the technology developments but that it has no plans to add support for ether. Qing said: \"We still keep an open mind to outstanding [digital currencies]. Any new digital currency needs time for market validation and acceptance ranging from issuing mechanisms to market liquidity.\" Asia image via Shutterstock   \n",

Decentralized autonomous trading is what digital currency was designed to do, and it is good to see new platforms pop up embracing this principle. Ethereum keeps capturing the imagination of both developers and digital currency enthusiasts all over the world. As new platforms are being announced around the clock, the ecosystem is growing into something very powerful. One of the latest announcements comes in the form of Etheropt, a platform that is live on the Ethereum mainnet which offers decentralized options exchange opportunities. Also read: Bitcoin Price Watch; A Shifted Range in Focus The Etheropt Decentralized Options Exchange Similar to , the Ethereum blockchain is all about decentralizing as many platforms as humanly possible. Although Bitcoin offers a variety of trading and exchange platforms, very few of them are decentralized at their core. Things could play out differently when Ethereum is involved, as impressive new platforms are coming to fruition. is one of those platforms, which is entirely decentralized. Moreover, this is not your everyday digital currency trading service either, as the main purpose is to exchange a variety of . What is even more interesting is how all of the options are call and put options related to the Ethereum price, denominated in US Dollar. The price per will be taken from multiple sources, including Poloniex - the main exchange for ETH trading - and will be verified by Reality Keys . Since no owner is running this platform, all of the trades, deposits, and withdrawals are executed automatically through an Ethereum smart contract . Decentralized autonomous trading is what digital currency was designed to do, and it is good to see new platforms pop up embracing this principle. What is even more appealing to potential traders is how Etheropt does not charge any fees. Unlike traditional exchange platforms, where a small portion of every trade is taken as a fee, no one will be making money from this concept other than the people successfully placing their options. Moreover, deposits and withdrawals are not subject to any fees either. Etheropt users can ether deposit funds directly in Ether, or use Shapeshift.io to convert any of the supported digital currencies into ETH. It is positive to see the Etheropt developer looking at various ways to make this platform more accessible to all kinds of digital currency enthusiasts.   \n",
       "9  Many of the people I meet believe that bitcoin is bad and will fail. It's rare to meet anyone who says that it could change the world and will succeed. But I've found one and he happens to have written a very good blog about it: Akin Fernandez, Entrepreneur Developer of Azteco . It's a long read, but worth it if you want to be informed. TL;DR If you have software that does something that is valuable, it will sell itself once people hear about it. What other people are doing wrong does not impact your software. There are some interesting and sportsmanlike debates happening around software properties and philosophy in the area of Bitcoin and the Blockchain. There are two distinct camps in this fascinating debate; the software developers and the non software developers . The non software developers can be characterized as Statist Sceptics . On top of not understanding how Bitcoin works, they do not like Bitcoin in principle , because they are Statists , and they are doubtful (without reason) that it can gain traction and spread globally. They have been Moving the Goalposts (a ) for several years in debates about Bitcoin, and have had to concede humiliating defeat many times as Bitcoin resists all their baseless nonsense and hopelessly bad predictions. First they said Bitcoin was a Ponzi Scheme, then they said it was only for \"techies\" then they said it was a bubble, then they said some other nonsense about it . Now, no one says any of those things, and they are onto the next iteration of their FUD; for example, the transaction rate is \"not fast enough\". They have conceded that Bitcoin works exactly as specified, and are running out of novel attacks. The rumblings of complete capitulation are starting to be written, and its a distinct pleasure to read them. Compounding the anti-Bitcoin proponent's frustration are voices that they recognize as deeply authoritative ( IBM ), saying that, \"The underlying technology could change everything\". Those that are retreating into that camp now say, \" And also Bitcoin \" when they talk about \"Blockchain Technology\" as the latest way to try an diminish the world changing effect Bitcoin will have. All the Bitcoin detractors have several characteristics in common. 1 They do not develop software 2 They do not understand or use cryptography 3 They do not have the language to describe cryptography 4 They have a quasi religious belief in the necessity of the State 5 Their only way in to the software world is by analogy Without an understanding of cryptography, it is not possible to understand why Bitcoin works. Without an understanding of Austrian Economics, it is not possible to understand why Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units. Without an understanding of software and its history, it is not possible to predict the future course Bitcoin will take. If you do not understand cryptography, specifically, Pretty Good Privacy , it will be difficult to understand the idea of a cryptographic signature, and its properties. Bitcoin is not a system of \"Smart Contracts\"; it is a system that uses cryptographic signatures to verify that a piece of text is now \"locked\" to the owner of a private key, who has the sole power to unlock that text and sign control over it to another owner of a different private key. All of this takes place on a public ledger. This is not at all like a contract, and neither is it \"smart\". In order to \"send\" Bitcoin to another person ( N.B. sending and receiving Bitcoin never actually happens, you simply sign an entry in the ledger and your balance, the number of entries you can sign, changes which is represented as a number ), you must use your private key to sign a message that is verified by the network. The system that controls this and verifies that the same signature on a piece of text can only be assigned to one key at a time is the breakthrough in The Double Spending problem , the explicit reason that Bitcoin was developed. This system can be used for other purposes that require registration of signed text, that is certain, but the Blockchain was developed specifically to facilitate the creation of a system of money that is free from government control, and immune to inflation. This idea, the idea of sound money, is anathema to Statists. They love government money that robs the poor and is the source of many of the troubles we face today. Do you see what I did there? I described what Bitcoin is, without using any poor analogies and stating only the facts. This is important, and I will come back to it later. Bitcoin does what it is designed to do. It does it very well. It will do it even better in the future, and this is something that non software developers do not understand; software is not fixed . The Bitcoin network we have today is not the same as the Bitcoin network at its start. There will be improvements in every area, including the speed at which the network runs. In the past, downloading the entire Blockchain was needed for every peer. Now you can download a pruned version that is smaller, and there are clients that do not require downloading the entire Blockchain at all . Anyone who presents a Straw Man Argument that Bitcoin cannot work because it takes \"too much\" time to confirm transactions, or the transaction volume is small compared to SWIFT or some other centralized system clearly cannot think , and doesn't know anything about software or its history. In the past before the global software precedents, they could have been excused for doubting the spread of any particular software or hardware, as the infamous Clifford Stoll did when he said the web \" would never take off\" but now, in 2015, we have numerous examples of devices and software that spread globally and that scale . The flash drive, which used to hold 64MB, now holds 64GB in the same form factor. There are one thousand and twenty four megabytes in one Gigabyte. That means in the picture below, the top drive has one thousand times more storage space than the bottom drive. I have no doubt that these same people, had you enthusiastically said to them, \"Your 64MB flash drive will hold a in a few years and cost \" would have scoffed at the idea. The same thing is happening with Bitcoin. Men who know nothing about software are scoffing at the idea that Bitcoin can change and improve. Its an a-historical perspective, to use parliamentary language. On IRC, they simply say, \"DERP!\". Often these people group the Blockchain and Bitcoin with tangentially related projects like Ripple, leaving out the crucial details that allow you to distinguish one from another and make a proper judgement, either by deliberate omission or ignorance. Ripple is very different to Bitcoin. It is a \"pre mined\" currency where all the tokens are created at once, by the developers. Bitcoin on the other hand, is designed quite differently. Its money creation mechanism follows a predictable curve, and is achieved through the process of competition between miners. This was done to keep the expansion of money supply under control until all the Bitcoin is generated, and is a direct result of the correct ideas in Austrian Economics. There is no boss, thankfully It is entirely right to say, \"Bitcoin is controlled by no one\". When this construction is used, it is meant to distinguish between Bitcoin and tools like Ripple, which is centrally controlled . Clearly, the Bitcoin miners control their own hardware and software, and the Bitcoin reference client is under the supervision of the man who is currently responsible for it. At the same time, the network requires consensus for it to operate properly, and it cannot be corrupted or gamed by a single entity. This is exactly what is meant by, \"controlled by no one\". It is not controversial to say this, and it is an accurate description of how the Bitcoin network operates. What the Statists do not like about Bitcoin not being under central control, is that its success is a strong, undeniable signal that control by democratic government is not needed for essential societal functions like money, and that there are better ways to organize every aspect of society that do not require government. The idea that money will no longer be the special preserve of the State and its corrupt central banks is deeply disturbing to these men, and so, they do anything they can (which is precisely nothing) and say anything they can (which is too much) to undermine the idea that Bitcoin does not need to be centrally controlled. Comparing any centralized service, like Ripple, which maintains a definitive central ledger in its offices, to Bitcoin is absurd . These two softwares are in completely different categories, and this bad comparison highlights the naked computer illiteracy of the men who make this febrile comparison. Ripple tokens, the way they were generated, who controls them and the software are all crucial pieces of information that you need to grasp before you can make a judgement about it or compare it to Bitcoin. Once you have a grasp of these, you can clearly see that Ripple is nothing at all like Bitcoin . Bitcoin, if you need to make a comparison to existing software, is more like the BitTorrent Protocol . Once again, if you have used BitTorrent, you will know what I am talking about. If you have not, you will not. There is nothing stopping anyone from making clear, detailed distinctions between different software projects. We can say that Ripple is nothing like Bitcoin, and X software is like Y software. This is useful, and shying away from the details is not; in fact, omitting the details of how software works only causes confusion, and helps spread uncertainty. GPG users and promoters are very used to the computer illiterate characters who will say things like, \"Yes! but I'm sure the government can read PGP messages, there is no way that they can't; they can do anything!\" without any evidence or knowledge of what they are talking about. It is only now that Edward Snowden has confirmed that GPG is beyond the reach of the NSA, that their ignorant anti GPG nonsense is forever dispelled as garbage. Once again, this is the Faulty Appeal to Authority fallacy ; GPG works because it works , not because someone says it works. The same is true of Bitcoin. No matter what software you are talking about, you need to make the case as to why it should be adopted by a user. If there is nothing like it to do the job your software can do, your sales pitch is easy. Bitcoin has this advantage; there is nothing like it in terms of what it does and its scale. Other software projects, have a harder case to make. Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssss! Imagine for yourself, a new software project, that wants to leverage a new technique. In order to sell the project, the facts about it need to be explained, and the software demonstrated. Anyone with experience in testing new software knows how these pitches go. They are very short and terse in the text (just as the Bitcoin White Paper is) and you are invited to run the software yourself. The install process is simple, and then the software either does what it developers claim it does, or it does not. Its all simple and straightforward. If the explanation is too long, and the software essentially unusable, then you have an indication that s omething might be wrong . Couple with that, the fact that it doesn't solve an outstanding hard or easy problem, and the second level alarm bells start ringing. BitTorrent and Bitcoin solve two very hard, distinct problems. BitTorrent solves the problem of how to share files to many people without a central server to distribute them serially. In the past, if you wanted to download a large file, you had to line up behind other people who were downloading the file one person at a time. With BitTorrent, the file is broken up into pieces and distributed out of order for re-assembly at the destinations in parallel. It is much faster than a serial download, and each person with a full or partial copy of the file can share the parts of it they have with other people who do not have those parts. Its all coordinated automagically in the software. BitTorrent is a breakthrough in how files are distributed, and was the result of many years of thought on the problem of how to distribute files without a central server. There had been other attempts at solving this problem , and it took several iterations before BitTorrent was developed by one man: Bram Cohen . Bitcoin has a similar history. For decades developers have been trying to solve the problem of creating an efficient intangible money token. After several attempts, the main problem, how to stop people spending the same token twice (a problem of synchronization) was solved in the form of Bitcoin. In each of these cases, the explanation is simple, the software solves a big problem, and you can download it and use it immediately to solve that specific hard problem. Its clear, unambiguous and instantly beneficial. Now back to our imaginary software project. This project does not solve an outstanding problem. It is designed to be a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, usable by any organization that wants to store data. This project is trying to re-purpose the Blockchain software to do the common and simple task of a database of a kind that runs on commodity hardware and free software. There is an explicit rejection of Bitcoin by its developers and promoters and the use of Bitcoin in this project, and most importantly, they have not figured out how to create a Blockchain without Bitcoin ; they try to hide it in a sea of text and jibes describing what they are doing. What is wrong with this picture? This imaginary software that I describe is not trying to solve a real problem . Any organization can download MySQL, hire some developers, not even top flight ones, and create extremely fast applications that do everything they could imagine they need. If they have an extra requirement of being able to audit who wrote what to the database and when, by adding cryptographic signatures to all entries and changes, they could have a completely audit-able and 100% reliable system where who did what and who owns what entry could be infallibly known. I will divert quickly to describe how it could be done. In a trusted organization that requires verifiable database entries, it is possible to use GPG signatures to stamp each entry in a way that makes them unforgeable and tamper evident . To do this, you issue everyone with write access to the database, a GPG Keypair that they use to sign entries and changes. Each signer will have a GPG Keypair, and a separate machine will automatically sign all entries with its own keypair, for time stamping and authenticating entries. To understand how this works and why it is infallible, you need to understand what GPG does, what a cryptographic signature is , and how it can be used to authenticate text, enable non-repudiation of a promise and the integrity of entries that are passed through this tool. Creating a system as I describe here does not require a breakthrough in software or theory. It is doable now, and can scale, and the tools are well understood and secure. The vaunted infallible, incorruptible public ledger features of this system can be had without using the Blockchain or an experimental derivative of it. If you want a database that is filled with entries that are not corruptible, you do not need a Blockchain to achieve it, you need infallible digital signatures precisely of the kind provided by GPG. One of the tell-tale signs of what we call \" \" are features that have no meaning. Imagine a software project that made the claim that they have, \"made Blockchains controllable\" That doesn't mean anything . All software is controllable by default, by the developers who write it. This is not a new feature or a breakthrough, it is simply the way things already are . It is very suspicious that a set of men attack the idea of Bitcoin, rather than expound the value of their own offering. The world needs more software. This is a fact. If you have something that is good, then by all means promote it. Saying that another piece of software, that by your own admission does not even overlap with your use case is a bad thing, quite rightly raises serious questions and suspicions about the true motivation behind such statements, and detracts from the thing you are claiming you are trying to sell. Its complicated Bitcoin is not, \"just a database\" anyone who says this does not understand what a database is, or the achievement of solving the Double Spending Problem. Databases are everywhere, common, and have been for decades. Bitcoin is causing global excitement precisely because it is not \"just a database\" , it is profound and new breakthrough. Bitcoin users do not have a common objective, but use a common means to achieve their objectives. Saying that Bitcoin users have a common objective is like saying people who use the fiat dollar or web servers have a common objective. Clearly they do not; web servers are used to serve web pages . The objectives of the people publishing pages are expressed in the text and images the users post for the world to see. Bitcoin is nothing more than a tool, just like any other tool, and nothing can be implied or imputed onto its users simply because they use it. The Bitcoin designer had a specific aim in mind, and part of his genius was to predict the human reaction to a money that is sound. As the true nature of money is further exposed by Bitcoin's spread, more people will come to distrust and reject fiat money issued by central banks, and the creator of Bitcoin's mission will be complete. Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized. The miners and software maintainers do not have \"limited supervision\" over the network; it is ordered by its operation and doesn't require supervision or control. To say that it does, demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. The only way you can claim that Bitcoin is supervised is to change the meaning of the word \"supervised\" and this is another thing that Bitcoin detractors do; they change the meaning of words to confuse and distract anyone who is trying to understand Bitcoin's operation as a newcomer or computer illiterate that can be swayed by bad arguments because they cannot distinguish the truth and lies about Bitcoin. Blockchains are run on software. They could also be run with pencils and paper and the mail. Blockchains are data . It is wrong to say however, that if you write the rules that you want expressed that they will \"do exactly what we tell them to do\". This is false. The Blockchain works precisely because the rules that govern its operation are finely tuned. The rules that govern its operation is the breakthrough. You cannot simply wave your hands, shout, \"die Bitcoin die\" at the top of your lungs and command that a Blockchain start exhibiting a set of features you desire. That is nonsense on stilts. Problems do not fall to the mind of man on demand. This is why they are problems . The Blockchain and by extension Bitcoin, if it were \"just a database\" or a simple matter of telling computers to \"do exactly what we tell them to do\" would have been invented at the same time that the database was invented . Blockchains are not just databases , they are something very new , and novel , and clearly, very hard to understand for some. You cannot, bearing this in mind, \"obtain the benefits of the Blockchain\" without Bitcoin. This idea, that you can have a Blockchain whilst entirely stripping away Bitcoin by simply writing some software should send up a giant red flag. It is entirely legitimate to desire and imagine and then write any manner of software you want. It may even be possible to create software that seems to be irrational on the surface, but which works. But there are some things that cannot be done , and even if they can, do not need to be done . As I described above, there is no need to use a Blockchain to secure database entries, make them infallible and trustable, and to extend that trust outside of the organization that holds the central database. No new techniques need to be developed to do this, so the question that immediately comes to mind is... Why are they doing this? Recording a cash deposit is easily done on a true database like MySQL, enforcement in a breach of contract is done by courts all the time. You cannot have software enforcement of a payment of money without the valuable token that can be confiscated by the software contract , so removing Bitcoin from your novel offering doesn't make any sense. You need the valuable token to ensure that both parties do what they promise to do. But if your philosophy is that the State should be the sole arbiter in disputes, there is no need for Blockchain contracts ; paper ones will do. It is only in the scenario that you want to replace Government courts as arbitrators in disputes, and lawyers to draft and interpret the law that Blockchain contracts have real, revolutionary utility. Adding an extra layer of complexity to the existing monopoly courts and banking system that even the promoters of the bad idea cannot explain coherently and convincingly is not a good business idea. You cannot simply \"choose to look at Blockchains as an open source database\". First of all the term \"Open Source\" refers to software licenses , not to the license that covers the content stored in them, and the Blockchain is not a simple database; it is far more than that , as I have explained. The entire idea of Blockchains and Bitcoin is that the transactions are irreversible . It is not a beneficial feature to create a Blockchain that has reversible entries on it. If you want that, you use PostgreSQL or MySQL not a hacked version of the software that runs the Bitcoin Blockchain. It is not practical from a business perspective to use tools for something other than what they were designed for, especially when there are mature tools that do exactly what you need without any risk. Take that into account and then superimpose the Procrustean idea of reversible Blockchain transactions, and essentially you are demonstrating that you have entirely missed the point and innovation of the Blockchain. The Blockchain was designed specifically to bring into being a new form of money. It literally is a money printing press. The form of money it generates is clean, ethical, anti-centralization and anti-State. This is why it rankles so many people who are invested in the idea of the State, and who are its certified gatekeepers. There is no right way to do any sort of software. Software is written to meet the needs of its users. If you want to use a database to store pictures of your navel, that is a correct use by default. There is no wrong way to use software, but there is a wrong way to use it if your goal is very specific. If you want an efficient database to be used internally in a corporation or enterprise, you do not need to re-engineer the Blockchain to remove Bitcoin from it to do so. You simply use MySQL or PostgreSQL. You use the right tool for the right job, and you do not force a tool on to a problem simply because the words that describe it are hip and fashionable. The Blockchain was specifically designed to allow Bitcoin and its properties to exist. By definition, that is the correct use case for that software; to create a decentralized, peer to peer digital money substitute without the Double Spending Problem. If you have another novel use case and you re-purpose the software used to create the Blockchain, that is good; but if you do not have a novel use case, you do not need to use the Blockchain. The Blockchain does not need anyone to be right about it, and it does not need to be defended, any more than arithmetic needs to be defended; it just is , and that is all there is to it. Its use and growth is its own defence. Its logic is its own defence. Its utility is its own defence. Most rational people do not have an objection to any software being re-purposed or re-designed. It simply doesn't matter what people choose to do with their time and what software they want to release. Software cannot attack other software. It is irrational violent men who attack other men for holding the \"wrong\" ideas , and of course, the anti Bitcoin men are very eager to physically attack Bitcoin users simply because they use Bitcoin . This is the stark difference in ethics of the evil men who are against Bitcoin and the men who are natural and normal. Software doesn't care about what view you take. It only executes as it is instructed to execute. Either your product works and achieves your aims or it does not. If it does, then you have to convince someone that your offering is worth risking their data and business on. This is the simple truth. A Blockchain is demonstrably not like any other database software. The superficial advantages that the Blockchain offers in terms of proving that something has happened at a certain time or that someone has the keys to unlock an entry, can be trivially replicated on MySQL or PostgreSQL with a GPG layer. Propagating messages in a verifiable way is easily done with SSL and GPG without a central server, using BitTorrent as the transport layer. Anyone familiar with GPG and the Web of Trust knows this. Permissions in MySQL are mature and reliable. If cost savings (and risk savings) are your aim, you would be far better off using the standard tools in an organization, which by its nature is centralized and where accountability and privacy are needed. The Blockchain is for a different purpose; its aim is to move accountability to the network and out of the hands of a central authority . If you are selling something to an organization that requires central authority, you do not need the Blockchain and its guarantees, because these are achievable by compulsion, and verification done by digital signatures. Transparent audit logs are achievable by other means than a Blockchain, and organizations more often than not, like to keep the details of their internal databases private , as they contain business sensitive data. Spreading out the database task into the public onto servers not under the control of the corporation is not something that is desirable. A product that does this is a solution to a problem no one is trying to solve looking for a client that does not exist; the complete opposite of Bitcoin and the Blockchain, which is a solution to a real problem that has been sought after for decades, that everyone needs. You do not need a consensus mechanism in a company where everyone is under centralized control. The board is the consensus mechanism. Computers today are so powerful, and storage so inexpensive, large databases can run on laptops without any problem. Distributing the load over many machines is something that is required only in \"Big Data\" Scientific applications, where the idea of the Blockchain and its record keeping abilities are simply not needed. There is a demonstration floating about from one of the \"Blockchains not Bitcoin\" companies, where they claim to have replicated Netflix on their software. Not only is this use case an example of piracy of copyrighted material, but this function is already efficiently done with BitTorrent on a global scale. These new Blockchain derivative products do not know what they want to be, and of course, Netflix does not want a distributed system in the way they devise, they want a centralized system so they can profit. The only thing they could want in terms of distributed architecture is the use of BitTorrent to stream films to their customers. Everything that is Blockchain is worthless to them...unless they start taking Bitcoin for on demand viewing of films, which of course, makes the case for Bitcoin as a transformative \"tech\". Someone said that Google could reduce their server costs with a hacked Blockchain. This is absurd. Hardware is very cheap. Re architecting Google's infrastructure to use a Blockchain offers them no advantage whatsoever. Google's needs are simple; they would pay billions for a very fast high level loss-less compression breakthrough. This would mean that their existing infrastructure could instantly have greater capacity with no hardware retrofitting. Apple just had something similar happen to them; a software developer wrote a novel image compression algorithm - they bought it and are incorporating into their software. That is real innovation ; solving specific problems that are well defined, with a novel approach. Uber, AirBnB, Spotify and the vast majority of companies all need simple databases to run their services. The true innovation that helps them is Bitcoin. It reduces the cost of processing payments, and eliminates the risk of fraudulent payments completely. This is not something to be sneered at; it is a revolution in how people pay for services , and it will completely destroy the Credit Card industry forever . What sort of man could possibly be against this? Or claim that it is anything less than one of the most profound beneficial breakthroughs in the history of computers and software? No Straw Man, Faulty Appeal to Authority, corporate gibberish or FUD can stop Bitcoin. Its use case is too obvious and compelling, the savings too great, the elimination of payer fraud too seductive. Bitcoin is real. It is not vaporware . It is here now, you can use it, benefit from it and you don't have to ask anyone's permission to do so. The permissionless nature of Bitcoin is an offence to the Statists, who openly say that every new technology or software should be exposed to scrutiny and regulation by the State, no matter what it is . Bitcoin, being immune from that sort of anti-Americanism , doesn't care what you think , or recommend; it simply is , it will do what it is meant to do, like BitTorrent does, and nothing can stop it. You are not required to like it, integrate with it, use it or even talk about it, and lying about it will not dissuade people from using it. The benefits are obvious to anyone who can think, and those who think instinctively like to save time and money and resent lining up and showing ID to use their own money. Setting up a Blockchain wallet takes literally five minutes and once its done, and you fund it , you have hand-held global access to the entire world market, as a bank, where you can send and receive an unlimited, unrestricted amount of money to anyone, anywhere, instantly. That's a good thing . This is the core of the reason why Statists dislike Bitcoin. It sets people free to do as they like with their own money. Unfortunately for them, its too late to stop Bitcoin. All the vaporware, wishful thinking and FUD in the world can't stop it. Years of bad press written by ignorant men have not stopped its growth, and every day that it grows it is going to become harder to retard. By all means, continue to write your own software, but do not believe for an instant that anything you say can stop Bitcoin. Only software can stop Bitcoin, and to do that, its function needs to be a better Bitcoin than Bitcoin , not any coin that is in any way crippled. Bitcoin has unleashed an idea into the world that will never ever go away . The world has changed. You can either deal with it, or leave it . 14rtDb46NQJkuqFJuHqZG3o6uAWwGbV58z   \n",

    "\n",
    "The main drawback of the memory-based technique is the requirement of loading a large amount of in-line memory. The problem becomes serious when the rating matrix becomes so huge in a situation that there is an extremely large number of people using the system. A lot of computational resources are consumed and system performance declines, and, thus, the system cannot respond to user requests immediately.  The model-based approach intends to solve such problems."
